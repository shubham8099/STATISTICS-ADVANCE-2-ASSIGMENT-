    " * Identically Distributed :- The random variables must be identically distributed, meaning they are drawn from the same        probability distribution. This ensures that each observation in the sample has the same underlying probability              distribution, which is a key requirement for the CLT to apply.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Finite Variance :- The random variables must have finite variance (i.e., they must not exhibit infinite variability).        Variance measures the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean. Finite variance ensures that the sample      mean or sum converges to a well-defined value as the sample size increases . \n",
    " \n",
    " * Finite Mean :- Similarly, the random variables must have a finite mean (expectation). The mean of a random variable          represents its average value, and having a finite mean ensures that the sample mean or sum is not skewed or distorted in    a way that would violate the assumptions of the CLT .\n",
    " \n",
    " * Large Sample Size: While not strictly an assumption in the traditional sense, the CLT is most effective and accurate when    applied to large sample sizes. As the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean or sum increasingly        approximates a normal distribution, as predicted by the CLT ."
